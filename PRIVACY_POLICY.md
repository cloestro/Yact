## YACT: Privacy policy

Welcome to the YACT app for Android!

This is an open source Android app. The source code is available on GitHub; the app is also available on Google Play.

We take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. This App is not collecting any data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please open an issue under https://github.com/cloestro/Yact/issues and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely
